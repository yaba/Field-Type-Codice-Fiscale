Codice Fiscale Field Type for PyroCMS

## How to install

Download the codice_fiscale field type and place it in addons/shared_addons/field_types or addons/[site_ref]/field_types and make sure that the folder you will copy is named "codice_fiscale" without quotes.

## How it works

This FieldType will check if the input is 16 chars long and if it is a valid format for an italian Codice Fiscale, make sure to set the field type as unique when using it via Streams module or with Streams API.
